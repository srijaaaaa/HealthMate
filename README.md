# HealthMate Project

## Introduction
HealthMate is a machine learning-based system designed to predict diseases based on specified symptoms. The goal is to provide accurate and early diagnoses, enabling medical professionals to improve patient outcomes.

## Models Used in the Project

### Decision Tree
A non-parametric model used for both regression and classification tasks. It partitions the input space into rectangles based on feature values and thresholds to make predictions.

### Random Forest
An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees using random subsets of data and features. It reduces variance and overfitting by combining predictions from all trees.

### Na誰ve Bayes
A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes independence between features and calculates class probabilities to make predictions.

## Developing an Accurate Disease Prediction System
HealthMate utilizes Decision Tree, Na誰ve Bayes, and Random Forest algorithms to predict diseases based on symptoms. Data was collected from medical professionals and hospitals to ensure accuracy.

## Evaluating the Performance of HealthMate
The performance of the algorithms was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics. Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy, followed by Na誰ve Bayes and Decision Tree.

## Results
HealthMate demonstrated promising accuracy scores:
- **Decision Tree**: 0.95
- **Na誰ve Bayes**: 0.91
- **Random Forest**: 0.94

## Implications of HealthMate Accuracy Scores
High accuracy scores indicate that HealthMate can assist healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses and treatment plans, potentially revolutionizing disease diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.

## Conclusion and Future Directions
HealthMate successfully developed a disease prediction system using machine learning. Future work includes expanding the dataset, testing on larger datasets, and integrating the system into existing healthcare infrastructure.
